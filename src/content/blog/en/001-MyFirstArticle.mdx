## 🚀 Website Update

Today I’m launching a major update to my personal website, now built with [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite) and [Swift](https://swift.org).

I’ve added the ability to write articles—and this is the very first one!  
From now on, I’ll be sharing my experiences, discoveries, and day-to-day challenges as a Swift developer.

> ⚡️ **No fixed schedule:**  
> I’ll post whenever I have something relevant to share—whether it’s problems, solutions, curiosities, or new technologies I’m exploring.

With this new version, I only have to focus on writing articles in Markdown; everything else is fully automated.

If you’re interested in **Swift, iOS, visionOS, Vapor, full-stack Swift development**, or just want to join me on this journey—welcome!
