## 🚀 Big update on my website!

Today I’m launching an **important update** to my personal website, which is now built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I’ve added the ability to **write articles** — and this is the first one!  
From now on, I’ll be sharing my experiences, discoveries, and daily challenges as a **Swift developer**.  
I might also share a bit about my personal life.

> ⚡️ **No fixed schedule:**  
> I’ll post whenever I have something relevant to share — whether it’s problems, solutions, curiosities, or new technologies I’m exploring.

With this new version, I can focus solely on writing articles in **Markdown**; everything else is fully automated.

If you’re interested in **Swift, iOS, visionOS, Vapor, full-stack development with Swift, and the Web**, or simply want to join me on this journey — welcome!
