## 🤔 What is Claude Code for me?

To move away from what everyone talks about 😂, I'm going to tell you about **artificial intelligence** from my personal experience.

I've integrated **Claude Code** into my projects, but for me it's much more than a tool: it's my **digital assistant** 👥, another member of my development team, an extension of my capabilities or, as the image represents well, **my technological shadow** 🌑.

> It doesn't replace me nor do I think it replaces any developer at the moment. Claude Code is only as good as you are or as you know how to use it 💡.

## 📋 My Golden Rules

I have **four fundamental rules** that I religiously apply with Claude Code:

1. 🔍 **Total Change Control**
- **I review everything** before implementing any changes
- It doesn't have permissions to modify files without my approval
- **Flow:** It provides me the plan → I review the changes → I understand them → I approve them (or not)
- This rule is **super important** to me. Giving it blind permissions doesn't align with my philosophy 🚫

2. 📝 **Claude.md as Project Bible**
- I work intensively on the `CLAUDE.md` file
- I define what the project is and establish **clear guidelines**
- It's my way of "training" Claude on my style and preferences
- **Result:** Responses more aligned with my vision 🎯

3. ⚙️ **Intelligent Configuration**
- I configure its settings with **official documentation paths**
- When I ask questions about specific technologies, it uses official sources
- This guarantees more precise and up-to-date responses 📚

4. 🚀 **Collaborative Work, Not Dependency**
- **Never** start from an empty IDE
- I always work on a code base I've already developed
- My flow: I start creating → I get stuck → I ask Claude
- **Recurring question:** *"Is there a cleaner and more efficient way to do this code?"* 🤝

## 💡 Limitless imagination

And here comes the interesting part: **Claude Code isn't just for programming** 🎨. You can use it for whatever comes to mind. Just ask yourself this question:

> *How can I make this idea work with Claude Code?*

One of the coolest ways I use it **outside of programming** is with my technical content consumption:

**I consume tons of programming content:**
- 🎓 Online courses
- 💊 Knowledge pills
- 🎤 Conferences and talks
- 🗣️ Technical debates
- 🎧 Specialized podcasts
- 🛠️ Practical workshops

**The typical problem:** You're programming and remember seeing something useful in a video, but... which one was it? At what minute? 😅

**My solution with Claude:**
1. I ask: *"Where is this talked about?"*
2. It returns:
   - 📹 The specific video or videos
   - ⏰ The exact timestamp where it's mentioned
   - 📄 A brief summary of the content

**Result:** **Wonderful!** ✨ Instant access to all my consumed knowledge.

## 🎯 Final Reflection

Claude Code has become my **technological shadow**. It's not magic, it doesn't do the work for you, but if you know how to use it correctly, it can **enormously enhance** your productivity and creativity.

The key is in establishing clear limits, maintaining control and using it for what it really is: **an exceptional assistant** that amplifies your capabilities, not one that replaces them 🚀.
