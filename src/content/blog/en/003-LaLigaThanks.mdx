### My website blocked during La Liga matches

If you're trying to visit my site during a La Liga match and it's not loading, you're not imagining things — it's actually being blocked.

In Spain, **La Liga applies aggressive anti-piracy measures**, and one of them is **blocking access to websites hosted on Cloudflare's network** during live matches. Unfortunately, this means that if your website is hosted on Cloudflare — like mine is — you might get caught in the crossfire, even if you're not streaming or distributing any illegal content.

Cloudflare protects and accelerates millions of websites globally, but due to La Liga's policy, **entire IP ranges or CDN edges may be blacklisted**, which affects **innumerable legitimate websites**.

### Why does this happen?

- La Liga uses automated systems and DNS-level blocking to restrict access to what they consider potential piracy sources.
- Cloudflare is widely used by all kinds of sites, including those that host pirated sports streams — so their IPs get flagged.
- As a result, many **innocent websites are blocked** during games, simply because they share infrastructure.

### What can you do?

- If you're in Spain and you can't access my portfolio during a match, try again later.
- If you're curious about the issue, there are online tools to test if a domain is being blocked.
- Or use a VPN to temporarily bypass the restriction (just for browsing my portfolio, of course 😅).

It's a frustrating example of how overzealous digital enforcement can harm the open web — even small developer portfolios like mine.

*“Thanks, La Liga!!”*
