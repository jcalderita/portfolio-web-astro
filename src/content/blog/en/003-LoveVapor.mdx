## ❤️ Swift on the server side

When I attended the *Swift Full Stack Bootcamp* at [Apple Coding Academy](https://acoding.academy), one of the modules we were taught was *Swift on the server side* using the [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) framework.

From the very start of the theory portion, my heart began to race, and by the middle of that very first class, I was already completely in love.

So, if you ask me *“What was your favorite module in the Bootcamp?”*, without a doubt, I’d say this one.

## 👍🏻 Why do I like it?

I’ve always thought that the **backend** is the **brain** of any application or website.  
It’s where all the *real action* happens: where information is processed (usually from a database) and prepared so that the end user receives it in the most **simple and transparent** way possible.

To be clear: **I’m not undervaluing the frontend**.  
In fact, I truly admire those who create incredible designs—heroes in my eyes—because that’s something I personally find impossible… although I do get along quite well with **SwiftUI**.

## 🧸 Playing with Vapor

In future blog posts, I’ll go into much more detail, but I can already share that I’ve been **having a lot of fun with Vapor**:

- 📦 Standalone package to configure different services  
- 🌐 **gRPC** server  
- 🗂 Data model with **views** (including *materialized views*), indexes, per-application permissions, and schemas  
- 🧮 Enums with automatic migrations  
- 🔑 **PassKey**  
- 📊 *Bulk inserts* for populating huge datasets  
- ⏱ Scheduled tasks with asynchrony  
- … and much more 🚀

> In various blog posts, I’ll be sharing a bit of everything.  
That said, even though I really enjoy Vapor and Swift on the server side, **it won’t all be about backend**… there will be room for many other topics I’m passionate about.
