## ☁️ Cloud Server

When you work with backend, unless you're working on a local network and nothing you do will go outside, you're going to need a cloud server and the sooner the better 🚀.

Working locally is great, but having a cloud server is a step forward, and it's better to start as soon as possible to have a development server in the cloud.
