## 🎭 Déjà Vu: The Web 2.0 Frameworks

Remember that golden era when a <span class="high">new web framework</span> popped up every week?

One that was more **modern**, more **powerful**, more **performant**, more **beautiful**… One that came to <span class="high">"kill" all the previous ones</span> and was going to become the <span class="high">only framework you'd ever need</span> 💀.

Spoiler: none of them killed anything, and now we have more frameworks than ever 😂.

Well then, <span class="high">welcome to the AI era</span>: same concept, but on steroids 🚀.

## 📱 Notification Fatigue

Picture this: you're peacefully **coding with your trusted AI**, workflow on point, productivity at its peak… and suddenly:

📢 **Notification:** *"Revolutionary new AI just launched!"*<br />
🎥 **Video:** *"How to use it in 10 minutes"*<br />
📝 **Tutorial:** *"Integrate it into your workflow TODAY"*<br />
💡 **Thread:** *"Why you should switch right now"*

And here comes the **funniest part**: the content creator who just 1 hour ago had a video explaining **"Why the old AI is the future"**, now has another video about **"Why the new AI is better than everything"** 🎪.

I don't blame them, honestly. It's their job to stay up to date and create relevant content. But as a consumer… **it's exhausting** 😅.

## 🏃‍♂️ The Impossible Race

If it's already **hard to keep up with the daily updates** of the AI you're using (and trust me, there are **so many** updates), imagine having to:

- Try every new AI that comes out ✅
- Learn its interface and quirks 📚
- Integrate it into your workflow 🔧
- Compare it with the ones you already use ⚖️
- Decide if the switch is worth it 🤔

<span class="high">Result:</span> Mission impossible 🎯.

And don't get me wrong: **I love having options**. In fact, it's **wonderful** that so much competition and innovation exists. More options = more better 👍🏻.

## 🚫 My Red Line

Now, there's something I'm **adamant** about:

<span class="high">I will never use an AI that requires full permissions from the start</span> 🔒.

None of that *"Give me full access to your machine and trust me"* stuff. **That's not for me**.

My philosophy is clear:

1. 📋 **Tell me what you're going to do** (or plan it out)
2. 👀 **I review the changes**
3. ✅ **I approve** (or don't approve)
4. 🚀 **Then you proceed**

No free will for AI with admin privileges. <span class="high">Full control</span> is my mantra, as I already shared in my article about [Claude Code](/en/blog/claude-code-en) 💪.

## 🌐 It's No Longer Just a Model

And here's what's **truly fascinating**: AI is no longer simply *"a model"* or *"an app"* that you install and use.

Now we have **complete ecosystems** 🏗️:

- Base + fine-tuned models ⚙️
- IDE integrations 💻
- Plugins and extensions 🔌
- APIs and SDKs 📡
- Orchestration platforms 🎼
- Specialized tools 🛠️

The speed at which all of this is evolving is **incredible**. What was science fiction 2 years ago is now your <span class="high">daily coding assistant</span> 🤖.

## 🎢 Living in an Incredible Era

At the end of the day, I believe we're living through something <span class="high">historic</span> 🎊:

🥊 **Battle of the IDEs**: VSCode vs. Cursor vs. WindSurf vs. Zed vs…<br />
⚔️ **Battle of the Frameworks**: React vs. Vue vs. Svelte vs. Solid vs…<br />
🤖 **Battle of the AIs**: Claude vs. ChatGPT vs. Gemini vs. Copilot vs…

Trying to keep up with everything is **exhausting**, I'll admit it. Personally, I find it <span class="high">impossible</span> 🙃.

But it's also **exciting**. Every day there's something new to learn, something to try, something that makes you rethink how you work.

---

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

The takeaway from all of this is simple:

**You don't need to use everything**. Really, you don't 🙅‍♂️.

Find **the tools that work for you**, learn to use them well, stay up to date with **their** updates, and it's perfectly fine to explore alternatives from time to time.

But don't drive yourself crazy trying to ride **every wave at once**. Pick your surfboard 🏄‍♂️, learn to use it well, and enjoy the ride.

And if one day you decide to switch boards, go for it. But make it a **conscious decision**, not a reaction to the <span class="high">FOMO</span> (*Fear Of Missing Out*) created by 47 simultaneous notifications 😂.

<span class="high">Happy coding</span> (with whichever AI you prefer) 🚀
